<p class="spacing">By contract of sale of land dated 29 June 2002, the vendor agreed to sell to Politis or her nominee certain land. A deposit was paid on signing the contract. This agreement was cancelled by deed of cancellation on 24 July 2002 and, on the same day, the vendor entered into a new contract with Politis Investments Pty Ltd, the trustee of the Politis family trust. The price was the same and the deposit was taken to have been satisfied by the payment of the deposit made by Politis in June under the original contract. Although the second contract was left undated, the parties treated it as having been executed on 29 June 2002.</p>
<p class="spacing">The Commissioner of State Revenue assessed both Politis and Politis Investments Pty Ltd to duty under s 31 of the <em>Duties Act 2000 &nbsp;</em> (Vic) on the basis of both the value of the property subject of the first agreement and the value of the real property transferred to the trustee.</p>
<p class="spacing">The taxpayer's appeal to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal was successful and the duty was reduced to $10,720. The Commissioner applied to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal and the application was treated as the hearing of the appeal itself.</p>
</div>
<div id="holdings">
<p class="spacing">
<strong>Held</strong> the tribunal erred in its construction of s 31 of the <em>Duties Act 2000 &nbsp;</em> (Vic); appeal allowed, tribunal's decision set aside and assessment affirmed</p>
<p class="spacing">(1) The tribunal incorrectly formulated the question to be answered before it. The question which called for decision was not <span class="g">“</span>whether the rights acquired by (Politis Investments Pty Ltd) under the second agreement (were) within the terms of the law acquired directly or indirectly under the first agreement”, but rather whether they were so acquired within the terms of s 31 of the <em>Duties Act 2000 &nbsp;</em> (Vic).</p>
<p class="spacing">(2) The statutory conception of direct or indirect acquisition of rights or interests is not confined to general law conceptions of the acquisition of rights or interests. The statutory conception of acquisition appears to be fairly broad and Parliament intended the section to extend to a number of different sorts of arrangements other than assignments.</p>
<p class="spacing">(3) The words <span class="g">“</span>acquire … directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the rights or interest of the first purchaser under the agreement” in s 31 of the <em>Duties Act 2000 &nbsp;</em> (Vic) must be construed as embracing not only the acquisition directly or indirectly of the very rights or interests of the purchaser (for example, by direct assignment or indirectly by a chain of assignments), but also the acquisition directly or indirectly of equivalent rights or interests (as, for example, by nomination or novation, or perhaps even by the acquisition of shares in a company which holds the right or interest or by acquisition of an interest in a trust of which the trustee holds the rights or interest). </p>

</p>
<p class="spacing">(4) It cannot be that every acquisition of rights or interest equivalent to those of a purchaser attracts the operation of s 31 of the <em>Duties Act 2000 &nbsp;</em> (Vic). The section must mean acquisition <em>from the purchaser</em> directly or indirectly of the purchaser's rights or of rights equivalent to the purchaser's rights. This means that the section is confined to cases in which the purchaser agrees to the transfer to the transferee of the rights or interest of the purchaser, or agrees to the creation in favour of the transferee (or in favour of another from whom the transferee may then directly or indirectly acquire rights or interest) of rights or interest equivalent to those which, but for the purchaser's agreement, would have inured under the contract of sale to the benefit of the purchaser.</p>
<p class="spacing">(5) Mechanisms attracting the operation of s 31 would include a nomination clause in the original contract, an express agreement to amend the original contract, an amendment constituted by conduct, as by a direction to the vendor to transfer to the second purchaser in lieu of the first and compliance by the vendor with the direction, and also a novation.</p>
<p class="spacing">(6) The deed of cancellation effected the acquisition, directly or indirectly, by Politis Investments Pty Ltd of the rights or interest of Politis under the original contract of sale within the meaning of s 31 and the transfer executed by the vendor in favour of Politis Investments Pty Ltd attracted the operation of s 31.</p>

<p>The question which the tribunal posed for decision was <span class="g">“</span>whether the rights acquired by (Politis Investments Pty Ltd) under the second agreement are within the terms of the law acquired directly or indirectly under the first agreement” (my emphasis). By <span class="g">“</span>the terms of the law” the tribunal evidently meant the terms of the general law, as opposed to any particular statutory conception of the direct or indirect acquisition of rights. Thus and not surprisingly the tribunal answered the question which it had set for itself, as follows: </p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p class="spacing">
<span class="g">“</span>I think that what happened was that the rights of the vendor were extinguished when the cancellation came into affect (sic); I think the second purchaser acquired rights, of exactly the same description and value, but they are not the same rights, and if they are not the same rights they cannot be said to have been acquired directly or indirectly from that first agreement.”</p>

<p>If the tribunal were correct in the formulation of the question, the answer which it gave would also be correct.

<p>In my opinion, however, the tribunal was not correct in the formulation of the question. Section 67A of the <em>Stamps Act 1958 &nbsp;</em> (Vic) — the precursor to s 31 of the <em>Duties Act 2000 &nbsp;</em> (Vic) — was enacted in 1994 to overcome the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in <em><span text="docguid" class="printableDocGuid"></span><span class="documentLink">Re Innvale Pty Ltd and Comptroller of Stamps</span></em><em><span text="docguid" class="printableDocGuid"></span><span class="documentLink">.</span></em><span class="mOver footnoteGo"><a href="#FTN-2" class="footnoteSup" id="ret-2">

<p>Evidently, the statutory conception of direct or indirect acquisition of rights or interest is not confined to general law conceptions of the acquisition of rights or interest. One need go no further than the reference in s 31(1)(c) (to the possibility of a contract of sale having been discharged by novation or agreement or of otherwise ceasing to exist) in order to see that the section is directed to something broader than merely assignments strictly so called. The proposition in s 31(6) that a person shall be taken to have acquired the rights or interest of another in the circumstances there postulated also conveys an intention that the statutory conception of direct or indirect acquisition of rights or interest reach beyond the ambit of assignments strictly so called. Furthermore, inasmuch as s 31(6) describes that sort of case as being without limit to the ways in which a person may be taken to acquire the rights and interest of another person in real property for the purposes of the section, the statutory conception of acquisition appears to be fairly broad. Clearly enough Parliament intended that the section extend to a number of different sorts of arrangements other than assignments. The question for present purposes is whether this case is one of them.</p>

<div class="wrapper spacing |pdc-para">
<div class="leftCol |pdc-number">14</div>
<div class="rightCol |node()[not(self::pdc-number)]">
<p>I take as the starting point that whatever may or may not be within the reach of s 31, it is apparent from the Second Reading Speech that the section was intended to apply to cases in which a purchaser having entered into an agreement for sale to the purchaser or nominee agrees to on-sell the land to a transferee and then directs the vendor to transfer the land directly to the transferee as the purchaser's nominee. That was the paradigm at which the section was said to be directed; for as it was put by the Treasurer in the Second Reading Speech for the bill for the introduction of s 67A of the <em>Stamps Act 1958 &nbsp;</em> (Vic): </p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p class="spacing">
<span class="g">“</span>The provisions which relate to sub-purchases of real property and the use of nominee clauses upon the purchase of real estate will be clarified. The amendment will prevent the use of nominee clauses as a device to avoid stamp duty.</p>
<p class="spacing">However, the genuine use of a nominee clause to enable the purchase of real property on behalf of a family member, a family company or a company related to the purchaser will not be affected. <span class="mOver footnoteGo"><a href="#FTN-5" class="footnoteSup" id="ret-5">
                    [5]
                </a></span>”</p>

<div class="wrapper spacing |pdc-para">
<div class="leftCol |pdc-number">15</div>
<div class="rightCol |node()[not(self::pdc-number)]">
<p>Plainly, however, under most nomination clauses the nominee would not acquire any rights as against the vendor, let alone the rights of the purchaser; for most nomination clauses constitute no more than a power in the purchaser to require the vendor to complete the contract by transfer of the land to the purchaser's nominee. <span class="mOver footnoteGo"><a href="#FTN-6" class="footnoteSup" id="ret-6">
                    [6]
                </a></span> In such cases the purchaser has rights as against the vendor to have the land transferred to the purchaser or to the purchaser's nominee, at least upon payment of the purchase price. And the purchaser has an interest in the land, in the nature of an equitable fee simple (assuming that the contract provides for purchase of the fee simple), although of course that really means no more than that the contract is susceptible to an order for specific performance at the suit of the purchaser. <span class="mOver footnoteGo"><a href="#FTN-7" class="footnoteSup" id="ret-7">
                    [7]
                </a></span> But the nominee does not acquire any rights as against the vendor, because the nominee is not privy to the contract. <span class="mOver footnoteGo"><a href="#FTN-8" class="footnoteSup" id="ret-8">
                    [8]
                </a></span> And for the same reason, the nominee has no standing in equity to obtain an order for specific performance of the contract. He must sue in the name of the purchaser or join the purchaser as a defendant. Therefore, such if any interest as the nominee may have in the land is one which derives from the purchaser, and relevantly the most that can be said is that the nominee may acquire an interest in the land equivalent to that which the purchaser had or would have had under the contract of sale.</p>

                    [9]
                </a></span> But even there the nominee would not acquire the purchaser's rights under the contract. The substitution of the nominee for the purchaser would work a novation of the agreement, and as I have observed already that means that the acts that were to be performed by the parties to the original contract in accordance with their rights and obligations under the original contract would be performed by the parties to the new contract in accordance with their rights and obligations under the new contract. Once again, within the meaning of the general law, the nominee would not acquire any right or interest of the purchaser under the contract.</p>

<p>How then does one construe the terms of s 31 in order to accommodate such a case and yet give to the section the effect which it was said it was intended to have? The answer appears to me to be to construe the words <span class="g">“</span>acquire … directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the rights or interest of the first purchaser under the agreement” as embracing not only the acquisition directly or indirectly of the very rights or interest of the purchaser (as, for example, by direct assignment or indirectly by a chain of assignments) but also the acquisition directly or indirectly of equivalent rights or interest (as, for example, by nomination or novation or perhaps even by the acquisition of shares in a company which holds the rights or interest or by acquisition of an interest in a trust of which the trustee holds the rights or interest).</p>

<div class="wrapper spacing |pdc-para">
<div class="leftCol |pdc-number">18</div>
<div class="rightCol |node()[not(self::pdc-number)]">
<p>One way to that conclusion is to reason that there are such strong indications of an intention to embrace equivalent rights and interest (as there are in s 31(1) and (6)) that the drafter of the legislation must have supposed that <span class="g">“</span>the whole or any parts of the rights and interest” included equivalent rights and interest.</p>

<p>An alternative or perhaps additional way of getting to the same result is by reasoning that the statutory conception of acquisition <span class="g">“</span>directly or indirectly” is a multi-dimensional concept. Conceived of in that fashion, one of the dimensions reflects the linear distinction that exists between acquisitions directly from a purchaser, as by direct assignment, and acquisitions indirectly from a purchaser, as by a chain of assignments that extends from the purchaser at one end via one or more intermediaries to the transferee at the other. The other or another dimension reflects the juridical qualitative distinction that exists between acquisitions directly from a purchaser, as by assignment (whether linearly direct or indirect is irrelevant), and acquisitions indirectly from a purchaser, as by the acquisition howsoever of rights or interest that are not the rights of the purchaser but are in substance equivalent to those of the purchaser.</p>

<p>It may be that the latter approach puts too much emphasis on the expression <span class="g">“</span>directly or indirectly” and assumes too much about the complexity of what the expression was intended to convey.

<p>Parity of reasoning affords support for the conclusion that the notion of direct or indirect acquisition of rights or interest within the meaning of s 31 of the <em>Duties Act 2000 &nbsp;</em> (Vic) includes the acquisition by the transferee of rights which are equivalent to the rights or interest of the purchaser. Whereas in the context of an anti-monopolisation legislation the evident purpose of a provision like s 50 of the <em>Trade Practices Act 1974 &nbsp;</em> (Cth) suggests that the notion of direct or indirect acquisition of shares includes the acquisition of shares by a subsidiary, so in the context of transactions duty legislation the evident purpose of an anti-avoidance provision like s 31 of the <em>Duties Act 2000 &nbsp;</em> (Vic) suggests that the notion of direct or indirect acquisition of the rights or interest of the purchaser includes the acquisition howsoever of rights or interest which are equivalent to those of the purchaser.</p>

<p>Of course, it cannot be that every acquisition of rights or interest equivalent to those of a purchaser attracts the operation of s 31.

In such a case the rights and interest acquired by the third party might be thought of as equivalent to the rights and interest of the defaulting purchaser under the original contract. But the section was not intended to apply in a case of that kind.</p>

<p>But the section itself provides for the limitation that avoids those sorts of excesses. The section is in terms limited to cases of direct or indirect acquisition by the transferee of the purchaser's rights or interest under the contract of sale. Taken in context I think that that must mean acquisition <em>from the purchaser</em> directly or indirectly of the purchaser's rights or of rights equivalent to the purchaser's rights.</p>

<p>What then does it mean to say that the section is confined to the acquisition <em>from the purchaser</em> of the rights or interest of the purchaser or the acquisition <em>from the purchaser</em> of rights or interest equivalent to those of the purchaser? Simply, I think, that the section is confined to cases in which the purchaser agrees to the transfer to the transferee of the rights or interest of the purchaser or agrees to the creation in favour of the transferee (or in favour of another from whom the transferee may then directly or indirectly acquire rights or interest) of rights or interest equivalent to those which but for the purchaser's agreement would have inured under the contract of sale to the benefit of the purchaser.</p>

<p>Subject to that overriding limitation, I envisage that there would be an acquisition of rights or interest of the purchaser within the meaning of the section where and howsoever a purchaser might agree to the substitution for its rights or interest under the contract of equivalent rights or interest in favour of the transferee (or in favour of another from whom the transferee may then acquire rights or interest equivalent to those of the purchaser). Therefore and without attempting an exhaustive catalogue of the mechanisms that might be employed, I think that they would include a nomination clause in the original contract, an express agreement to amend the original contract, an amendment constituted of conduct, as by a direction to the vendor to transfer to the second purchaser in lieu of the first and compliance by the vendor with the direction, and also a novation.</p>

<p>I appreciate that a novation is in one sense different to the other mechanisms that I have mentioned. It involves the rescission and thus extinction of the original contract and of rights still inchoate at the time of rescission, whereas in the other cases mentioned, the purchaser's rights and interest under the original contract of sale inure, notwithstanding that they may be altered or modified as a result of the mechanism in question, to inform the rights or interest acquired by the transferee. But in the context in which the section falls to be considered I do not see that as being a difference of significance. Regardless of whether the mechanism chosen is that of original agreement or amendment or novation, the result will be the same. <span class="mOver footnoteGo"><a href="#FTN-14" class="footnoteSup" id="ret-14">
                    [14]
                </a></span> In each case the transferee will receive rights or an interest equivalent to those or that which would have inured to the purchaser under the contract of sale if the mechanism had not been activated. And while of course there is a difference of substance between the elements of original agreement, and amendment by further agreement, and novation, which for other purposes may be of critical importance, I do not accept that the operation of a tax avoidance provision directed to the imposition of duty upon nominee transfers was intended to vary according to distinctions of that kind. There is nothing in the text of the s 31 to suggest that it was so and as has already been seen the second reading speech bespeaks the contrary.</p>

<p>In this case the deed of cancellation had the same parties as the original contract of sale. It provided for the cancellation of the original contract of sale and for the deposit moneys paid under that contract to be held on trust until a new contract was executed with the transferee. It was executed simultaneously with the new contract of sale and a copy of the new contract of sale was attached to it as too was the original vendor's statement. In effect therefore, and by the express agreement of Mrs Politis, the deed achieved the substitution for Mrs Politis of Politis Investments Pty Ltd and the creation in favour of that company of an interest in the land equivalent to that which Mrs Politis would have held if the original contract of sale had been completed.</p>
